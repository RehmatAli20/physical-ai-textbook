# Expected Learning Outcomes

By completing the capstone project, students will achieve a comprehensive
understanding of how Physical AI systems are designed and evaluated.

---

## Technical Understanding

Students will be able to:
- Explain how AI systems interact with physical environments
- Describe the role of ROS 2 in coordinating robotic components
- Understand how simulation reduces risk in robotics development

---

## System-Level Thinking

Unlike traditional programming tasks, the capstone encourages system-level
thinking.

Students learn to:
- Break complex problems into layers
- Define clear interfaces between components
- Design workflows instead of isolated functions

---

## Example Insight

A key realization students often gain is that **intelligence alone is not enough**.

A powerful AI model that ignores physical constraints can fail in real-world
scenarios. Physical AI requires balancing reasoning with perception and action.

---

## Preparation for Advanced Work

After completing the capstone, students are prepared to:
- Explore advanced robotics platforms
- Study reinforcement learning for control
- Integrate AI agents with real or simulated robots
- Transition into research or industry roles involving embodied AI

---

## Final Reflection

The capstone project represents the transition from theoretical AI to
real-world intelligence. It reinforces the idea that the future of AI lies
not only in thinking systems, but in systems that can **act intelligently
within the physical world**.
