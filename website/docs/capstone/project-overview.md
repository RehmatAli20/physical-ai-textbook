# Capstone Project Overview

The capstone project represents the final and most important component of this
Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. It is designed to combine all concepts
learned throughout the textbook into a single, coherent system.

The goal of the capstone is to design a **conceptual autonomous humanoid system**
that can receive human commands, understand its environment, plan actions, and
execute those actions in a simulated physical world.

This project does not focus on building real hardware. Instead, it emphasizes
**thinking like a Physical AI engineer**, where intelligence must be connected
to perception and action.

## Purpose of the Capstone

The capstone exists to answer one key question:

**How does AI move from abstract reasoning to real-world action?**

Throughout the course, students learn individual components such as:
- Physical AI principles
- ROS 2 communication
- Simulation environments
- AI perception systems
- Vision-Language-Action models

In the capstone, these components are integrated into a single system that behaves
like an intelligent embodied agent.

## Example Scenario

Consider the following human instruction:

> “Go to the table and pick up the bottle.”

To a human, this instruction is simple.  
To a robot, this instruction requires multiple steps:

1. Understanding the language
2. Identifying the table and bottle
3. Planning a safe path
4. Moving its body
5. Reaching and grasping the object

The capstone project demonstrates how Physical AI systems handle this complexity.

## Scope of the Project

The capstone focuses on:
- Simulation-based execution
- Conceptual design rather than full implementation
- Understanding system interactions
- Applying Physical AI reasoning

This approach allows students to focus on **intelligence design**, not mechanical
engineering.
