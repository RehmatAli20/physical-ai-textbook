# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

### A Complete Textbook on Embodied Intelligence, Robotics, and AI in the Physical World

---

## 🚀 What is This Book?

This textbook introduces **Physical AI** — artificial intelligence systems that
operate in the real world rather than remaining confined to digital environments.

Unlike traditional AI models that process text or images, Physical AI systems must:

- Sense the physical environment  
- Understand space, motion, and constraints  
- Make decisions under uncertainty  
- Execute actions safely in the real world  

This book bridges the gap between **AI software** and **robotic bodies**.

- Embodied intelligence and Physical AI foundations  
- ROS 2 as the nervous system of robots  
- Simulation and digital twins using Gazebo and Unity  
- AI-driven perception with NVIDIA Isaac  
- Vision–Language–Action (VLA) systems  
- How modern humanoid robots reason, move, and interact
