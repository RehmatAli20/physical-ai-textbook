# Unity for Robotics Simulation

Unity is a real-time 3D engine originally designed for game development, but it
is increasingly used in robotics for visualization and interaction.

Unlike physics-focused simulators, Unity excels at creating visually rich and
interactive environments.

## Why Unity Is Used in Physical AI

Unity is useful for:
- High-quality visualization
- Human–robot interaction experiments
- Simulating realistic indoor environments

**Example:**  
A service robot interacting with humans in a virtual hospital environment can
be tested in Unity to study usability and safety.

## Unity vs Gazebo

| Feature | Gazebo | Unity |
|------|--------|-------|
| Physics Accuracy | High | Moderate |
| Visual Quality | Moderate | Very High |
| ROS Integration | Native | Via bridges |
| Use Case | Control & dynamics | Interaction & UX |

Both tools serve different purposes and are often used together.

## Unity and AI Training

Unity can generate synthetic data for training AI models. This is especially
useful for vision-based tasks.

**Example:**  
Thousands of images of objects can be generated under different lighting
conditions to train object detection models.

## Unity as a Teaching Tool

For students, Unity helps visualize abstract concepts such as:
- Robot perception
- Path planning
- Interaction zones

This makes learning Physical AI more intuitive and engaging.
