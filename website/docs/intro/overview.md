# Course Overview

This textbook introduces the fundamentals of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

Physical AI focuses on intelligent systems that operate in the real world rather than
remaining limited to digital environments. These systems must sense their surroundings,
reason about physical constraints, and perform actions safely and effectively.

The course bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and robotics by covering
robot middleware, simulation platforms, and AI-driven decision making. Students will
learn how intelligent agents can be connected to physical bodies through modern
robotics frameworks.

This book is designed for students who want to understand how AI moves from code
to real-world action.
