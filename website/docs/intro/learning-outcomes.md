# Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will gain a clear understanding of how
artificial intelligence can be applied to physical systems such as robots and
humanoid machines. The learning outcomes are designed to build both conceptual
and practical understanding.

## 1. Understand Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

Students will learn what makes Physical AI different from traditional digital AI.
While digital AI systems operate on text, images, or numbers inside a computer,
Physical AI systems must interact with the real world.

**Example:**  
A chatbot can answer questions, but it does not need to worry about gravity or
collisions. A humanoid robot, however, must understand balance, movement, and
its surrounding environment to avoid falling or causing damage.

This outcome helps students recognize why embodiment is a critical requirement
for intelligent robots.

## 2. Learn the Role of ROS 2 in Robotic Systems

Students will understand how ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) acts as the
communication backbone of modern robots.

ROS 2 allows different parts of a robot—such as sensors, controllers, and AI
modules—to communicate with each other in a structured and reliable way.

**Example:**  
A camera node may publish images, while a navigation node subscribes to those
images to decide where the robot should move. ROS 2 manages this data flow
without tightly coupling the components.

## 3. Understand Simulation and Digital Twins

Students will learn why simulation is essential before deploying AI models to
real robots. Simulation environments allow safe testing of robot behavior
without the risk of hardware damage.

**Example:**  
Instead of testing walking algorithms on a real humanoid robot, students can
first test them in a simulated environment where falling does not cause
physical damage.

This outcome helps students understand how digital twins reduce cost and risk.

## 4. Gain Awareness of AI-Driven Perception and Control

Students will learn how modern AI techniques are used for perception, navigation,
and decision making in robots.

This includes understanding how robots process visual data, recognize objects,
and plan actions based on their environment.

**Example:**  
A robot can detect an object using a camera, estimate its position, and then
decide how to move its arm to grasp it.

---

## 5. Understand Vision-Language-Action Systems

Students will explore how language models can be integrated with robotic systems
to convert natural language commands into physical actions.

**Example:**  
When a human says “Move to the door,” the system must interpret the command,
identify the door, plan a path, and move safely toward it.

This outcome shows how AI reasoning and physical execution work together.

## 6. Prepare for the Capstone Project

By the end of the course, students will be prepared to design a conceptual
autonomous humanoid system that can receive commands, plan actions, and interact
with its environment in a simulated setting.

The capstone project brings together all concepts learned throughout the course
and demonstrates a complete Physical AI pipeline.
